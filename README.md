In this Tic Tac Toe game, I used Java networking with TCP sockets to simulate a 2 separate endpoints connecting to a gam server.

### How to run

Compile and run `GameServer.java` followed by two iterations of `Client.java` (can be on another computer, just need to change the game server address so it is reachable).

Then, follow the instructions and beat your opponent at Tic Tac Toe!
